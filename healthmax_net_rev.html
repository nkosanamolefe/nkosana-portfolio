            <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <p>
              HealthMax, a top Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company in the
              shampoo market, struggles to maximize revenue and profit due to
              rising competition and changing consumer preferences. The company
              needs better pricing and product mix strategies to stay
              competitive, strengthen its brand, and grow sustainably.
            </p>

            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>
              HealthMax, a leading FMCG shampoo brand, is addressing rising competition and changing consumer preferences by optimizing its product mix and expanding into high-growth markets. Despite challenges, HealthMax achieved 4% growth in 2020, driven by its flagship brand Shinez (22% market share) and strong regional dominance in the South (47% market share). To boost profitability, the company is focusing on its top-performing product, Starburst Ultra Soft, which generated $3.5 million in revenue in 2022. By entering the fast-growing Organic subcategory (projected 20% growth in 2024) and launching a 50ml travel-sized version of Starburst Ultra Soft, HealthMax aims to tap new consumer segments, increase revenue, and solidify its position as a market leader. These data-driven strategies will drive sustainable growth and enhance competitiveness in the evolving FMCG landscape

            <h2>Insights Deep Dive</h2>

            <h3>Fast Moving Consumer Goods</h3>
            <p>
              In 2020, HealthMax achieved 4% growth, reversing the decline seen
              by its top competitors in 2019. This growth was largely driven by
              Shinez, one of its flagship brands, which grew by 7.7%, offsetting
              a -5% decline from the previous year.
            </p>

            <p>
              From April 2022 to March 2023, the shampoo category generated over
              $98 million in revenue. Shinez held an average market share of
              22%, while Starburst maintained 12% across all regions from 2019
              to 2022. HealthMax dominates the South region with a 47% market
              share, significantly outperforming other regions, highlighting its
              strong presence in that area.
            </p>

            <h3>Net Revenue Management</h3>
            <p>
              HealthMax is strategically shifting investments to focus on its
              most profitable products. In 2022, the company achieved $20
              million in net sales, with Starburst Ultra Soft as the top
              product. It sold more than 1 million units and generating $3.5
              million in net sales.
            </p>

            <p>
              The shampoo portfolio has a strong gross margin of 69%, meaning
              69% of the average selling price is profit. Using a profitability
              matrix, Starburst Ultra Soft 100ml was identified as the most
              important product due to its significant contribution to revenue
              and profit. This data-driven strategy helps HealthMax prioritize
              high-performing products to maximize returns and support growth.
            </p>

              alt="HealthMax Profitability Matrix"
            />

            <h4>New category opportunity</h4>
            <p>
              HealthMax currently operates in only 2 out of 5 shampoo
              subcategories and is considering expanding into a new one. Using a
              pivot table, the Organic subcategory was identified as the
              fastest-growing, with a growth rate of 276%. Based on historical
              trends, the Organic subcategory is projected to grow by 20% in
              2024 compared to March 2023 levels, reaching an estimated 1
              million units for the full year. This presents a significant
              opportunity for HealthMax to enter a high-growth market.

            <h3>Optimizing Net Revenue</h3>
            <p>
              Research shows that travelers prefer 50ml shampoo bottles.
              Currently, HealthMax’s smallest size is 100ml. To tap into this
              market, the company can launch a 50ml version of its best-selling
              product, Starburst Ultra Soft.
            </p>

            <p>
              The retail price for the 50ml pack can be set at a 50% markup
              based on the `price per ml` of the 100ml pack. With a `net price`
              of $2.30 and a `cost of goods sold (COGS)` of 0.70, the 50ml
              format is projected to generate $265,960 in `net sales`, assuming
              its `2022 volume` will be 10% of the 100ml pack’s volume. This
              move allows HealthMax to target a new consumer segment and boost
              revenue.
